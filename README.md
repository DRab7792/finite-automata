finite-automata
===============

This is a C++ class implementation of a finite automata with a driver program and sample data. To compile the program type 'make rabinowitz' into the command line. Then to run, type './rabinowitz <fa file> <string>.' The output will show the series of states and whether or not the string was accepted or rejected.
